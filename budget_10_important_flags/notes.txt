adders 5-40 all with 10 of the "best" flags
number_of_runs = 10000
error_rate = 0.001
epsilon_target = 0.005

- all achieve error rate of icm_small with epsilon_target
- 0.475 - 0.650 mod is sufficient (see 10_flags_mod.png)
- smaller (i.e. more expensive) error mod needed for smaller circuits
- unlike previously, now sqrt(dq) flags achieve i-2 or i-3 approx. Maybe before I had a bug?

Conclusion:
Flags are nice for logical error > 0.1 cases, but is there any point in examining those cases?

What next?
